## Seqs

# Setup

Ruby should be installed. This was written using 3.0.1 but any recent version should work.

# Running tests

```
rake test
```

# Running the script

This script includes a sample dictionary which you can use. An out of the box example would be:

```
./seqs --input-file resources/dictionary.txt --words-file words.txt --seqs-file seqs.txt
```
